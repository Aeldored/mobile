// Start continuous security monitoring
enhancedWiFiService.startSecurityMonitoring(
  scanInterval: Duration(seconds: 15),
);
```

### 2. **Use Security Dashboard**

```dart
// Add to your home screen or create dedicated security tab
SecurityDashboard(
  showDetailedView: true,
  onRefresh: () => enhancedWiFiService.refreshSecurityAnalysis(),
  onThreatTapped: (assessment) => _showThreatDetails(assessment),
)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Network Scanner**

```dart
// Replace existing network list with enhanced scanner
WiFiScannerWidget(

  enableContinuousScanning: true,
  onNetworkTap: (network) => _showNetworkDetails(network),
  onConnectTap: (network) => _connectSecurely(network),
  onSecurityDetailsTap: (assessment) => _showSecurityAnalysis(assessment),
)
```

### 4. **Listen to Security Events**

```dart
// Monitor security assessments
enhancedWiFiService.securityAssessmentStream.listen((assessments) {
  // Handle security updates
  final highRiskNetworks = assessments.where(
    (a) => a.threatLevel == ThreatLevel.high || a.threatLevel == ThreatLevel.critical
  ).toList();
  
  if (highRiskNetworks.isNotEmpty) {
    _showSecurityAlert(highRiskNetworks);
  }
});
```

## üéØ Security Features

### Evil Twin Detection Algorithm

The system uses a multi-factor approach to detect Evil Twin attacks:

1. **SSID Duplication Analysis**
   - Identifies networks with identical SSIDs but different BSSIDs
   - Analyzes signal strength patterns for proximity indicators
   - Compares security configurations between duplicates

2. **Signal Strength Profiling**
   - Detects unusually strong signals indicating close proximity
   - Compares with historical signal patterns
   - Flags sudden signal strength changes

3. **Security Configuration Monitoring**
   - Identifies security downgrades (encrypted ‚Üí open)
   - Monitors for configuration changes over time
   - Validates expected security levels for known networks

4. **MAC Address Validation**
   - Analyzes vendor OUI patterns
   - Detects randomized or suspicious MAC addresses
   - Cross-references with known malicious device database

### Threat Scoring System

Each network receives a comprehensive security assessment:

- **Security Score**: 0-100 numerical score
- **Security Grade**: A-F letter grade
- **Threat Level**: Low/Medium/High/Critical classification
- **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 confidence in threat detection
- **Specific Threats**: Detailed list of detected security issues

### Real-time Monitoring

Continuous security surveillance includes:

- **Periodic Scans**: Configurable interval scanning (default 15 seconds)
- **Historical Tracking**: Network behavior analysis over time
- **Alert Generation**: Immediate notifications for high-risk networks
- **Post-Connection Monitoring**: Security verification after connection

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Security Analysis

```dart
// Get security assessment for a specific network
final assessment = await enhancedWiFiService.getNetworkSecurityAssessment(networkId);

if (assessment != null) {
  print('Security Grade: ${assessment.securityGrade}');
  print('Threat Level: ${assessment.threatLevel.displayName}');
  print('Detected Threats: ${assessment.detectedThreats.length}');
  
  if (assessment.shouldAvoidConnection) {
    print('WARNING: High-risk network detected!');
  }
}
```

### Secure Connection Flow

```dart
// Connect with security verification
final result = await enhancedWiFiService.connectToNetworkSecurely(
  network: targetNetwork,
  password: userPassword,
  performPreConnectionAnalysis: true,
);

switch (result) {
  case WiFiConnectionResult.success:
    print('Connected securely with monitoring active');
    break;
  case WiFiConnectionResult.error:
    print('Connection blocked due to security assessment');
    break;
}
```

### High-Risk Network Detection

```dart
// Monitor for Evil Twin attacks
final evilTwinThreats = enhancedWiFiService.getEvilTwinThreats();
final highRiskNetworks = enhancedWiFiService.getHighRiskNetworks();

if (evilTwinThreats.isNotEmpty) {
  print('‚ö†Ô∏è ${evilTwinThreats.length} potential Evil Twin attacks detected');
  for (final threat in evilTwinThreats) {
    print('- ${threat.ssid}: ${threat.primaryRecommendation}');
  }
}
```
