# Fix DisConX Launcher Icon - Step by Step

## Problem
The app is still showing the Flutter logo instead of the DisConX logo after building and installing.

## Root Cause
The `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons` command was not executed before building the APK, so the default Flutter icons are still in place.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Generate the Icons
```bash
cd C:\Users\Dred\Desktop\disconx-suite\mobile
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

### Step 2: Verify Icons Were Generated
After running the command, you should see output like:
```
✓ Successfully generated launcher icons
✓ Creating default icons Android
✓ Overwriting the default Android launcher icon with a new icon
✓ Creating adaptive icon Android
✓ Overwriting the default Android adaptive launcher icon with a new icon
```

### Step 3: Check Generated Files
The command should have replaced these files with your logo:
```bash
# Check if icons were updated (you can view these files)
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
```

### Step 4: Clean and Rebuild
```bash
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release
```

### Step 5: Uninstall and Reinstall
```bash
# Uninstall the old app with Flutter logo
flutter install --uninstall-only

# Install the new app with DisConX logo
flutter install
```

## Alternative Quick Fix

If the above doesn't work, try this alternative approach:

### Method 2: Force Icon Regeneration
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\Dred\Desktop\disconx-suite\mobile

# Delete existing icon files
del android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-*\ic_launcher.png

# Regenerate
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

# Build fresh
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release
flutter install --uninstall-only
flutter install
```

## Verification

After completing the steps:
1. Look at your Android device home screen
2. The app icon should now show the DisConX logo
3. Check the app drawer - the logo should appear there too
4. The Flutter logo should be completely replaced

## If Still Not Working

### Check Configuration
Make sure your `pubspec.yaml` has:
```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true
  ios: false
  image_path: "assets/logo_png.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/logo_png.png"
```

### Check Logo File
Verify the logo exists:
```bash
dir assets\logo_png.png
```

The file should be there and be a valid PNG image.

## Expected Result
After following these steps, your DisConX logo will appear as the app icon on all Android devices instead of the Flutter logo.
