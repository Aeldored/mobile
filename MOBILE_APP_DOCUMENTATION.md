## 🎯 Project Overview

### Application Name
**DisConX** (DICT Secure Connect) - Government Wi-Fi Security Platform

### Purpose & Problem Statement
DisConX is a **government-grade cybersecurity mobile application** developed for DICT-CALABARZON to address the critical security threat of **evil twin Wi-Fi attacks** in public networks. The application serves as a comprehensive security solution that protects Filipino citizens from malicious network spoofing attacks while providing educational resources about Wi-Fi security.

### Key Problems Addressed
1. **Evil Twin Attacks**: Malicious actors creating fake Wi-Fi networks with identical names to legitimate ones
2. **Public Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities**: Lack of security awareness when connecting to public networks
3. **Government Network Security**: Need for centralized monitoring and protection of government Wi-Fi infrastructure
4. **Citizen Education**: Absence of accessible cybersecurity education tools for the general public

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Filipino citizens using public Wi-Fi networks
- **Secondary**: Government employees and IT administrators
- **Tertiary**: Educational institutions and cybersecurity professionals

### Inspiration & Impact
The project was inspired by the increasing frequency of cybersecurity threats in the Philippines, particularly in public spaces like malls, airports, and government facilities. DisConX aims to create a **safer digital environment** by empowering users with real-time threat detection and comprehensive security education.

## 🏗️ Development Model

### Development Journey: Agile Scrum Approach

When the team began developing DisConX, they knew this wasn't going to be a typical mobile app project. They were building a security-critical application for the government, dealing with Wi-Fi threats that could compromise people's personal data. The traditional "build it and ship it" approach simply wouldn't work here.

#### Why Agile Scrum was Chosen

The story of choosing Agile Scrum started with the team's first meeting with DICT-CALABARZON. They had a clear vision of what they wanted - a tool to protect citizens from Wi-Fi threats - but like most cybersecurity projects, the details were complex and constantly evolving. New types of attacks emerged, government requirements changed, and the team needed to adapt quickly.

Scrum felt natural because it matched how cybersecurity actually works: discover threats, test solutions, get feedback, and continuously improve. Just like how security researchers work in cycles - observe, analyze, defend, repeat - the development process followed the same rhythm.

#### How the Team Organized Their Work

The team settled into a comfortable rhythm of **2-3 week sprints**. At first, they tried the standard 2-week sprints, but they quickly realized that security testing takes time. Vulnerability assessments or government compliance checks cannot be rushed. So they extended their sprints to give themselves breathing room for thorough testing.

The team naturally organized around their strengths:
- **Aeldred** became the Scrum Master and lead developer, handling the technical direction
- **DICT representative** served as the Product Owner, ensuring they stayed aligned with government needs
- The rest of the team handled mobile development, security testing, and quality assurance

#### The Team's Daily Rhythm

Every morning, the team would start with a quick 15-minute standup. These weren't formal presentations - more like conversations over coffee. "What did you discover yesterday? What are you working on today? Any blockers?" The key was keeping it real and practical.

What made the team's standups unique was the security focus. They would regularly discuss things like:
- "Found a new edge case in evil twin detection"
- "Government whitelist sync is taking longer than expected"
- "Need to test on more device types"

#### Sprint Planning: Where Strategy Meets Reality

Every 2-3 weeks, the team would sit down with their DICT stakeholders for sprint planning. These sessions were part strategy meeting, part technical discussion, and part reality check. They would look at the government's priorities, assess their technical capabilities, and figure out what was actually achievable.

The government context added interesting dynamics. Sometimes a feature that seemed simple from a technical perspective required extensive compliance checks. Other times, a complex security algorithm was straightforward to implement but needed careful explanation to stakeholders.

#### Learning from Each Sprint

The team's sprint reviews became mini-demonstrations where they would show real working features to government stakeholders. There's something powerful about seeing a threat detection algorithm actually identify a suspicious network in real-time. These demos weren't just status updates - they were moments where everyone could see the value being created.

Sprint retrospectives were where the team got honest about what was working and what wasn't. Early on, they realized they needed more time for security testing. Later, they discovered that government approval processes had their own timeline that they needed to respect.

#### The Clean Architecture Foundation

Throughout this iterative process, the team maintained a clean architecture approach. This wasn't about following a textbook - it was about building something that could evolve. When new security requirements emerged (and they always did), they could adapt without rewriting everything.

The architecture helped them maintain quality while moving fast. Each layer had clear responsibilities: UI handled user interactions, business logic managed security algorithms, and data layer handled Firebase and local storage.

#### Challenges the Team Navigated

Government projects have unique rhythms. Approvals take time, stakeholders have busy schedules, and security requirements can't be rushed. The team learned to build buffer time into their planning and stay flexible with their scheduling.

The biggest challenge was balancing speed with security. Agile encourages rapid iteration, but security requires careful testing. They found their sweet spot by doing security reviews within each sprint rather than saving them for the end.

#### What Made It Work

Looking back, the team's success came from treating Scrum as a framework rather than a rigid process. They kept the parts that helped them - regular feedback, incremental delivery, continuous improvement - and adapted everything else to fit their government cybersecurity context.

The key was maintaining focus on their core mission: protecting citizens from Wi-Fi threats. Every sprint, every feature, every decision came back to that fundamental purpose. When stakeholders could see consistent progress toward that goal, everything else fell into place.
